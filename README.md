## About

This WordPress plugin allows its WordPress users to hold accounts with tokens called seeds.

The administrator has the option to create the seeds, and the newly created seeds will be deposited into a default account.

Once the seeds are created, the other users can use the seeds and transact them between each other.

In essense, it makes a WordPress site function as a bank, and the seed token is the currency.
It can be used, for example, to create a community driven currency or for reward tokens for a business.

## Shortcodes

The plugin provides a number of shortcodes that can be used to create the user experience on the frontend of the WordPress site. The shortcodes are:

* `[seeds-balance]` - Show the current balance for the currently logged in user.
* `[seeds-history]` - Show the account history for the current user.
* `[seeds-send]` - Show a form to let the current user send seeds to another user.

The look and feel of the user interface is further tweakable using CSS.
